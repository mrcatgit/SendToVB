# SendToVB

**SendToVB,** is a software that permit to:
*"Programmatically send emails with attachments using the default email client"*
You can use the tool **SendToVB,** a small **command line**  utility software, to  **send email with attachments** by a **programmed way** using the **default email client!**

**SendToVB** is compatible with **Many Email Clients** like (Outlook, Thunderbird, Mailbird, ecc,)

**How to use it**
For instructions see the blog page of **IT-manager's Life:**  https://itmanagerslife.blogspot.com/2011/12/send-attachment-with-default-email.html

**SendToVB** was born in 2012 for internal needs.  
It was coded in  **Visual Basic.NET 2005** and requires the installation of  **[.NET Framework 2.0 runtime or higher]**  which is often installed on new PCs. 
Internally it automatically uses  **MAPI functions**  when it has to send emails  **with attachments**, and use the command **mailto** to send email  **without attachments**.

After 11 years, I decided to make it available as **Open Source**. 

**SendToVB** is partly based on code from two developers.
